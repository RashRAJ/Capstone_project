# Capstone_project

This project aims to deploy a highly sophisticated car rental platform using Kubernetes as the orchestration framework. The platform will adopt a decoupled architecture, with Node.js serving as the backend technology and React as the frontend. Kubernetes will enable the application to achieve exceptional scalability, maintainability, and resilience.

Users of the platform will benefit from a comprehensive range of features, including the ability to browse, add, and remove cars from the rental inventory, schedule, and book test drives, as well as manage their existing bookings seamlessly. 

Project Overview 

To accomplish this, the project will heavily rely on Amazon Web Services (AWS) as the primary service provider, making use of various pertinent services and cutting-edge technologies offered by AWS. This selection allows for optimal utilization of resources and cost-efficiency, ensuring a streamlined and reliable deployment.

Overall, this project aims to deliver a technologically advanced car rental platform that harnesses Kubernetes's power, leverages AWS services' benefits, implements industry-standard practices, and prioritizes security. By doing so, it provides an optimized, scalable, and user-friendly solution for the car rental industry.
